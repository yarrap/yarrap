### About

Hey, there! I am a masterâ€™s student currently majoring in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I come equipped with 2 years of experience as a Senior Analyst at Tiger Analytics, where I collaborated with a CPG Client, applying Lasso, Bayesian Regression, and NLP techniques to drive impactful insights.
